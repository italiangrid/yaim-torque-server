#
# DESCRIPTION : This configuration file contains the variables needed to configure the
#               TORQUE server whose default values do not need to be changed by sys admins
#               unless they are interested in a more advanced configuration. This file
#               should be used together with site-info.def.

# Set it to 'no' if you want to disable the /var/spool/pbs/server_priv/nodes configuration in YAIM
CONFIG_TORQUE_NODES="yes"

# Define this variable to the name of a file containing the munge key
# of the torque server. This file will be copied to
# /etc/munge/munge.key if that file does not exist. The site admin is
# responsible for generating the munge key once and safely copying it
# to all hosts that need it. If it is empty, YAIM will not install a
# munge key.
